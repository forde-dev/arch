Welcome to my ArchLinux Shell Scripts, I wrote these to automate
the the installation of ArchLinux, The configuration on these scripts
worked perfectly for installation on my system, but i can't garrentee
it will work on another computer, but with a few adjustments to the 
scripts when trouble shooting im sure you can get it working too.

HOW TO USE:


*First download the tar.gz file*

    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/fordetek/arch-haswell.git

*or*

    $ curl -SLO https://gitlab.com/fordetek/arch-haswell/-/archive/master/arch-haswell-master.tar.gz

*Next extract it*

    $ tar zxf arch-haswell-master.tar.gz && cd arch-haswell-master

*Finally run the base script*

    $ sh base.sh

*now just follow instuctions provided by the install and you are all set*
