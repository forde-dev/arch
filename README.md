Welcome to my ArchLinux Shell Scripts, I wrote these to automate
the the installation of ArchLinux, The configuration on these scripts
worked perfectly for installation on my system, but i can't garrentee
it will work on another computer, but with a few adjustments to the 
scripts when trouble shooting im sure you can get it working too.

HOW TO USE:


*First download the tar.gz file*

    $ curl -SLO https://github.com/fordetek/arch/archive/master.tar.gz

*Next extract it*

    $ tar zxf arch-master.tar.gz && cd arch-master

*Finally run the base script*

    $ sh base.sh

*now just follow instuctions provided by the install and you are all set*
